This is a game called 'Mini Chess'. It is a smaller version of a regular chess on 6x6 board.
I have created this game to practice object-oriented programming. This was done using Python 3.7.9 and kivy library.

The game can be run by executing main.py file with Python interpreter. All the required Python packages can be found in 'requirements.txt'.
